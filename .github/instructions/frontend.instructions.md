# Frontend contract

`library/` is the published component package and `example/` is its consumer. Keep public exports and peer dependencies compatible.
`package.json` and the lockfile own framework and Aksel versions. Use existing
TypeScript types, validation helpers and component patterns. Do not infer
package APIs or import a pattern from a different frontend.

Prefer Aksel components and semantic tokens. Preserve existing responsive
layouts, loading/error/empty states and explicit Norwegian number/date
formatting. Keep Tailwind exceptions consistent with the local Aksel rules.
Test application behavior through the existing test setup; do not duplicate
upstream component tests or add a survey/authentication dependency by default.
